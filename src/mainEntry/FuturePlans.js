      <p>
        My immediate plans are to begin strengthening skills related to
        security, speed, and mastery of the more complex aspects of React. I
        also must take a bit of a deeper dive into BEM descriptors.
      </p>
      <p>
        I would really like to take a deep dive into Node and React Native. Upon
        mastery of these I feel that I can safely change my title to Fullstack
        Developer.
